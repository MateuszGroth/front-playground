## Stories format

As the recommended way to write Stories is using CSF [Component Story Format](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/react/api/csf).
As Storybook announced the CSF version 3 we will write new stories in this format.

To create a stories file we create file
`<ComponentName>.stories.tsx`

## Story default export

For correct story listing and providing information to Storybook addons we need to export default the Story metadata.
`title` allow to list component story on Storybook navigation and `component` is required to automated prop table generation.

```typescript jsx
const meta: Meta<typeof Rating> = {
  title: 'Components/Rating',
  component: Rating,
}

export default meta
```

## Writing stories

Each named export object is a single Story. Order of named exports is represented in Storybook navigation.

### Overview Story

Each component should have the `Overview` story. Overview story is a basic story that renders component in its default state.

```typescript
type Story = StoryObj<typeof Rating>

export const Overview: Story = {}
```

### Story represents state

As story should be representation of state we should keep it simple and create separate story for different states.

```typescript jsx
// Showcase the state of Rating component where variant is set to "triangles"
export const Triangles: Story = {
  args: {
    variant: 'triangles',
  },
}

// Showcase the state of Rating component where variant is set to "starts-outline"
export const StarsOutline: Story = {
  args: {
    variant: 'stars-outline',
  },
}
```

### Prop overview story

When component has prop that represents a lot of different states (more than 3) we create prop overview story.
It is a story that renders component with each possible prop choice. As such story renders more than default component we have to use the `render` function.

Using `PropsOverviewTemplate` component as wrapper allows to present variants in more legible way.
`PropsOverviewTemplate` takes `variantPropName` props to properly show then prop variant name.

```typescript jsx
export const Variants = {
  // ❕We need pass args to render function and to component to auto source code generation for docs
  render: (args) => (
    <PropOverviewTemplate variantPropName="variant">
      {Object.keys(ButtonVariants).map(variant => {
        return (
        <Button {...args} key={variant} variant={variant}>
          {variant}
        </Button>
        );
      })}
    </PropOverviewTemplate>
  ),
};


export const Sizes = {
  render: (args: ButtonProps) => (
    <PropOverviewTemplate variantPropName="size">
      <Button {...args} variant="primary" size="x-small">
        x-small
      </Button>
      <Button {...args} variant="primary" size="small">
        small
      </Button>
      <Button {...args} variant="primary" size="medium">
        medium
      </Button>
    </PropOverviewTemplate>
  ),
};
```

### Common props for stories

If stories needs to have a common props we should set it on meta object.

```typescript jsx
const meta: Meta<ButtonProps> = {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
  args: {
    variant: 'primary',
  },
}
```

#### Using other Stories args

It is possible to use composition by sharing args object defined on story level between other stories.

```typescript jsx
export const StarsOutline: Story = {
  args: {
    variant: 'stars-outline',
  },
}

export const StartsWithError: Story = {
  storyName: 'With error',
  args: {
    ...StarsOutline.args,
    error: 'Somethings went wrong',
  },
}
```

### Styling stories

For case where we need to style the view for story we use [Decorators](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/react/writing-stories/decorators)

Each story in a project is wrapped by `<div className="braintrust-ui-component-story">`.
That allows us to use styles from `src/StoriesStyles/style.scss` within stories.

To use this classes we need to wrap component or single story with extra markup by decorators.

#### Component decorator

```typescript jsx
const meta: Meta<ButtonProps> = {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
  args: {
    variant: 'primary',
  },
  decorators: [Story => <div className="flex gap-2 flex-wrap">{Story()}</div>],
};
```

#### Story level decorator

```typescript jsx
export const Default = {
  decorators: [
    (Story) => (
      <div style={{ margin: '3em' }}>
        <Story />
      </div>
    ),
  ],
};
```

### Story props controls

For simple stories that renders component itself in different states Storybook generates the table with props controls.

[Controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls) allows to easily interact with props within the story preview.

#### Customize controls

Controls are created based on component type. Each control can be also configured by using `argTypes`.
[All available controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls#annotation)

For some complex types Storybook not always create controls properly. Look at example.

##### Button example

`Button` component has `variant` prop which is typed as `type ButtonVariants = EnumType<typeof Variants>`.
That makes Storybook miss proper control creation. To improve control we configure it through `meta` component:

```typescript jsx
// Shorthand
const meta: Meta<ButtonProps> = {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
  args: {
    variant: 'primary',
    children: 'Text',
  },
  argTypes: {
    variant: { control: 'select', options: ButtonVariants },
  },
}

// Extended  argsType object

argTypes = {
  variant: {
    control: { type: 'select', options: ButtonVariants },
    description: 'Set the variant prop for button',
    // Reconfigure the table in docs page
    table: {
      // Sets type
      type: { summary: 'string', detail: 'Detailed description of type' },
      defaultValue: { summary: '-' },
    },
  },
}
```

#### Story actions

Story Actions is a plugin that allows to take a look on preview of event emmited by an action.
We have globaly set Storybook to figure out and handle as action props with name starting from `on*`.

For other actions we could handle this by `argTypes`

```typescript jsx
const meta: Meta<ButtonProps> = {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
  argTypes: {
    onClick: {
      action: 'clicked',
    },
  },
}
```

## Docs page

Based on the stories defined in `*.stories.tsx` Storybook automatically generates the docs page.

Just as the order of story exports had significance in the order of those stories in navigation, the same order will be reflected in the docs page.

### Improvements

#### Component description

To add description of component at the top of the docs page use meta component `parameters` object.

```typescript jsx
const meta: Meta<typeof Rating> = {
  title: 'Components/Rating/RatingCSF3',
  component: Rating,
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: 'Rating component renders the sequence of shapes to represents avarage rating.',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

#### Story description

To add description to single story use parameters object at story level.

```typescript jsx
export const Sizes = {
  parameters: {
    docs: {
      description: {
        story:
          'A button supports `x-small`, `small` and `medium` size. Default size is `medium`.',
      },
    },
  },
  render: (args: ButtonProps) => (
    <>
      <Button {...args} variant="primary" size="x-small">
        x-small
      </Button>
      <Button {...args} variant="primary" size="small">
        small
      </Button>
      <Button {...args} variant="primary" size="medium">
        medium
      </Button>
    </>
  ),
};
```

### Props table

Storybook generates the props table automatically based on component types.

To improve props description we need to annotate types with comments

```typescript jsx
export interface RatingProps extends RatingPropsMUI {
  /**
   * Controls rendered shape of rating component items.
   */
  variant?: 'triangles' | 'stars' | 'stars-outline'
  /**
   * Controls size of Rating shape.
   */
  size?: Size
  /**
   * Controls color of shape.
   */
  color?: Color
  /**
   * Allows to add custom css styles for icons.
   */
}
```
